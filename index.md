## What is this?
A collection of my notes on various subjects. The primary reason to create this is that I usually find it easier to grasp stuff better when I write things down after a few weeks of studying them. Another reason is that I indexed this collection of notes and made it searchable, so looking for a reference to a result / theorem / concept that I've studied before should ideally become faster.

1. I'd be really grateful if you find any errors and report them to [notes@aseemrb.me](mailto:notes@aseemrb.me).
2. If you have suggestions for topics that you want included here (in the vicinity of mathematics and CS in general), I'd be happy to take them if time permits.
