## What is this?
A collection of my notes on various subjects. The primary reason to create this is that I usually find it easier to understand stuff better when I write things down. Another reason is that I indexed this collection of notes and made it searchable, so looking for a reference to a result / theorem / concept that I've studied before should ideally become faster.

## How can I use this?
1. If you're interested in browsing a topic in general, navigate to it on the left panel.
2. If you're looking for something specific, search for it using the search bar on top.
