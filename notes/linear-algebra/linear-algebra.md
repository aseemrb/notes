A recollection of a few preliminary ideas and developments in Linear Algebra from the perspective of theoretical computer science behind data analysis and machine learning. It is supposed to serve as a reference for some common results and properties, hence, most proofs are omitted. Most of the content is inspired by the book [Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lax) by [Peter D. Lax](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Linear_Algebra.html?id=YF2CQgAACAAJ) and a [course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/) by [Gilbert Strang](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/) in Spring 2018 at MIT.
