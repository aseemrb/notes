This section is about measure theoretic probability and high-dimensional statistics. It is not intended to be a first encounter with probability theory and is meant for a slightly advanced audience. However, I will try my best to include references and results that explain something uncommon in the notes. Most of the content is inspired from a course I took at UWaterloo, given by [Prof. Yi Shen](https://sites.google.com/site/yishenenglish/), [Vershynin](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/)'s [High-Dimensional Probability](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.pdf) and [Durrett](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/)'s [Probability: Theory and Examples](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf).

Both of the mentioned books are application-focused, but contain a huge wealth of theoretical results.
