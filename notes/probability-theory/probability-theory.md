This section talks about high-dimensional probability theory. It is not intended to be a first encounter with probability theory, but is meant for a slightly advanced audience. However, I will try my best to include references and results that explain something uncommon in the notes. Most of the content is inspired from [Roman Vershynin](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/)'s book [High-Dimensional Probability](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.pdf) and [Rick Durrett](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/)'s book [Probability: Theory and Examples](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf).

Both of these books are application-focused, but contain a huge wealth of theoretical results.
