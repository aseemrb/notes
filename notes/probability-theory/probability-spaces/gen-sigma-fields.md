For a sample space $\Omega$, let $A$ be a set of subsets of $\Omega$. Suppose we want to generate a $\sigma$-field using $A$. Note that there may be many different $\sigma$-fields $\mc{F}$ such that $A\subseteq\mc{F}$. Hence, to make this generation unique, we will focus on the smallest such $\mc{F}$.

|:---------------|
| The $\sigma$-field generated by $A$, denoted by $\sigma(A)$, is the intersection of all the $\sigma$-fields $\mc{F}_i$ such that $A\subseteq\mc{F}_i$. |
