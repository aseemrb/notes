For a sample space $\Omega$, let $\mc{A}$ be a set of subsets of $\Omega$. Suppose we want to generate a $\sigma$-field using $\mc{A}$. Note that there may be many different $\sigma$-fields $\mc{F}$ such that $\mc{A}\subseteq\mc{F}$. Hence, to make this generation unique, we will focus on the smallest such $\mc{F}$.

| <span class="fs-4 text-green-100">$\sigma$-field generated by $\mc{A}$</span> |
|:---------------|
| The $\sigma$-field generated by $\mc{A}$, denoted $\sigma(\mc{A})$, is the intersection of all the $\sigma$-fields $\mc{F}_i$ such that $\mc{A}\subseteq\mc{F}_i$. |

## Examples
1. For $\mc{A}=\\{\emptyset\\}$ or $\mc{A}=\\{\Omega\\}$, $\sigma(\mc{A})=\\{\emptyset, \Omega\\}$, the trivial $\sigma$-field.
2. For $\mc{A}=\\{A\\}$ for some $A\subset\Omega$, $\sigma(\mc{A})=\\{\emptyset, A, A^c, \Omega\\}$.
3. For $\mc{A}=\\{\\{\omega\\}: \omega\in\Omega\\}$, $\sigma(\mc{A})=\\{A: A$ is countable or $A^c$ is countable $\\}$.

| <span class="fs-4 text-green-100">Exercise</span> |
|:---------------|
| 1. Show that for any collection $\mc{A}$ of subsets of $\Omega$, $\sigma(\mc{A})$ is indeed a $\sigma$-field. |
| 2. Verify example 3 above. |

## The Borel $\sigma$-field
Denoted by <span class="text-purple-000">$\mc{B}$</span>, the Borel sigma-field is defined on the sample space $\Omega=(0,1]$. It is the <span class="text-purple-000">$\sigma$-field generated by $\mc{B}_0$</span> (recall that we saw this set earlier as [a counterexample for $\sigma$-fields]({{ site.base_url }}/probability-theory/probability-spaces/sigma-fields#counterexample)), which is the set of all finite unions of disjoint intervals of $\Omega$. Note that one can define the Borel $\sigma$-field on $\RR$ in the same way as we did for $\Omega$.

It is well known that <span class="text-purple-000">$\mc{B}$ can also be generated by open, closed, and half-open sets</span>. Formally, let
- $\mc{Q}=\\{(a, b]\subseteq\Omega\\}$
- $\mc{R}=\\{(a, b)\subseteq\Omega\\}$
- $\mc{S}=\\{[a, b]\subseteq\Omega\\}$
- $\mc{T}=\\{[a, b)\subseteq\Omega\\}$

The notation above may feel a little weird, but essentially it says that $\mc{Q}$ is the set of all intervals of $\Omega$ that are open on the left and closed on the right (similarly for the other three sets).

| <span class="fs-4 text-green-100">Exercise</span> |
|:---------------|
| Prove that $\sigma(\mc{Q}) = \sigma(\mc{R}) = \sigma(\mc{S}) = \sigma(\mc{T}) = \mc{B}$. |
| *<span class="text-purple-000">Hint:</span> The countably infinite union of a carefully chosen sequence of left-open intervals (elements of $\mc{Q}$) can generate an open interval (an element of $\mc{R}$). Similarly, the countably infinite intersection of a chosen sequence of open intervals (elements of $\mc{R}$) can generate a closed interval (an element of $\mc{S}$), and so on.* |
