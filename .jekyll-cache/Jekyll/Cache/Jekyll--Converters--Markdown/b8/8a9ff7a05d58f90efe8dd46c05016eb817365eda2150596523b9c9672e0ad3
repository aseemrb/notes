I"é<p>This section is about measure theoretic probability and some related topics. Most of the technical content is inspired from a course I took at UWaterloo, given by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yishenenglish/">Yi Shen</a> and <a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/">Durrett</a>â€™s popular book <a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/">Probability: Theory and Examples</a>, with some additional tidbits that helped me build a good intuition on the subject.</p>
