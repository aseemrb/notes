I"<p>This section talks about high-dimensional probability theory. It is not intended to be a first encounter with probability theory, but is meant for a slightly advanced audience. However, I will try my best to include references and results that explain something uncommon in the notes. Most of the content is inspired from <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/">Roman Vershynin</a>â€™s book <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.pdf">High-Dimensional Probability</a> and <a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/">Rick Durrett</a>â€™s book <a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf">Probability: Theory and Examples</a>.</p>

<p>Both of these books are application-focused, but contain a huge wealth of theoretical results.</p>
