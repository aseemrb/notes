I"<p>This is my recollection of the most fundamental ideas and developments in Linear Algebra, and is supposed to serve as a reference for some common results and properties. Most of the content is inspired by the book <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Linear_Algebra.html?id=YF2CQgAACAAJ">Linear Algebra</a> - Peter D. Lax, and <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/">Gilbert Strangâ€™s Spring 2018 course on OCW</a>.</p>
