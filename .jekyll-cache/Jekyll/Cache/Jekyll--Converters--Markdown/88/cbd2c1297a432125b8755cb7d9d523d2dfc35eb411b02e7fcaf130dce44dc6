I"<p>There are five very popular factorizations for matrices.</p>

<h3 id="lu-decomposition">LU Decomposition</h3>
<p>This is the lower-upper (LU) decomposition, and the factorization can be viewed as the matrix form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination">Gaussian elimination</a>. This is the usual decomposition used in algorithms to</p>
<ul>
  <li>solve a square system of linear equations,</li>
  <li>compute the inverse of a matrix, and</li>
  <li>compute the determinant of a matrix</li>
</ul>
