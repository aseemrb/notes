I"t<p>This section is about measure theoretic probability and high-dimensional statistics. It is not intended to be a first encounter with probability theory and is meant for a slightly advanced audience. However, I will try my best to include references and results that explain something uncommon in the notes. Most of the content is inspired from a course I took at UWaterloo, given by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yishenenglish/">Yi Shen</a> and <a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/">Durrett</a>â€™s <a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf">Probability: Theory and Examples</a>.</p>
