I"¥<p>There are five very popular factorizations for matrices. In the literature, the word <code class="highlighter-rouge">decomposition</code> is often used instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">factorization</code>.</p>

<h2 id="lu-decomposition">LU decomposition</h2>
<p>This is the lower-upper (LU) decomposition, and the factorization can be viewed as the matrix form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination">Gaussian elimination</a>. This is the usual decomposition used in algorithms to</p>
<ul>
  <li>solve a square system of linear equations,</li>
  <li>compute the inverse of a matrix, and</li>
  <li>compute the determinant of a matrix.</li>
</ul>

<p>We factor $A = LU$, where $L$ and $U$ are lower and upper triangular matrices.</p>

<h2 id="qr-decomposition">QR decomposition</h2>
<p>Here we factor a matrix into an <a href="../orthogonal-matrices/">orthogonal matrix</a> $Q$ and a triangular matrix $R$. A popular method to compute this factorization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process">Gram-Schmidt process</a>.</p>

<p>The QR decomposition provides a way of solving a system of equations $Ax = b$ without inverting the matrix $A$. Since $Q$ is orthogonal, we have $Q^T Q = I$, so $Ax=b$ is equivalent to $Rx = Q^T b$, which is easier to solve since R is triangular.</p>

<p>We factor $A = QR$, where $Q$ is orthogonal and $R$ is upper-triangular.</p>
