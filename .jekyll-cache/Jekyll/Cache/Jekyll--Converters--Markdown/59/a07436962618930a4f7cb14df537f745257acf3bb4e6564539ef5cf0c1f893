I"<p>Let a matrix $Q$ have orthonormal columns. The most important property of such a matrix is that</p>

\[Q^TQ = I\]

<p>But what about $QQ^T$? A little thought reveals that $QQ^T = I$ only if $Q$ is a square matrix, but not in general. In this square case, $Q$ is called orthogonal (or orthonormal). Itâ€™s confusing to say orthogonal when we actually mean orthonormal, but most results rely on the fact that a bunch of orthogonal vectors $v_i$ can be made orthonormal by scaling them to have $\lVert v_i\rVert = 1$. Hence, in a lot of places we see the word orthogonal being used when the authors actually mean orthonormal.</p>

<p>A simple example is the $2$-dimensional rotation matrix:</p>

\[Q = \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta &amp; -\sin\theta \\
    \sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta
    \end{pmatrix}\]
