I"S<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>A collection of my notes on various subjects. The primary reason to create this is that I usually find it easier to grasp stuff better when I write things down after a few weeks of studying them. Another reason is that I indexed this collection of notes and made it searchable, so looking for a reference to a result / theorem / concept that I’ve studied before should ideally become faster.</p>

  <li>I’d be really grateful if you find any errors and report them to <a href="mailto:notes@aseemrb.me">notes@aseemrb.me</a>.</li>
  <li>If you have suggestions for topics that should be included here (in the vicinity of Mathematics and CS), I’d be happy to take them; although, I write here only when I’m bored and can’t sleep, so no promises.</li>
