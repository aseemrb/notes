I"À<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>A collection of my notes on various subjects. The primary reason to create this is that I usually find it easier to understand stuff better when I write things down. Another reason is that I indexed this collection of notes and made it searchable, so looking for a reference to a result / theorem / concept that Iâ€™ve studied before should ideally become faster.</p>
