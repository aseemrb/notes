I"è<p>If a matrix $Q$ has orthonormal columns, then we say itâ€™s orthogonal (or orthonormal). Itâ€™s confusing to say orthogonal when we actually mean orthonormal, but most results rely on the fact that a bunch of orthogonal vectors $v_i$ can be made orthonormal by scaling them to have $\lVert v_i| = 1$. Hence, in a lot of places we see the word orthogonal being used when the authors actually mean orthonormal.</p>

<p>The most important property of an orthogonal matrix $Q$ is that</p>
