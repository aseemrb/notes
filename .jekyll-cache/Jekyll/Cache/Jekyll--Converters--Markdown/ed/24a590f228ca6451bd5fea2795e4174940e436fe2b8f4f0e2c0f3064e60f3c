<p>A symmetric matrix $S$ is positive definite (PD), if it has the following equivalent properties. Positive definiteness is a notion of thinking about symmetric matrices as positive or negative in the same sense as one would think about a real number.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All eigenvalues of $S$ are positive, i.e., $\lambda_i(S) &gt; 0$.</li>
  <li>For any vector $x \neq 0$, the energy contained in $x$ for $S$ is positive, i.e.,</li>
</ul>

\[x^{\rm T}Sx &gt; 0.\]

<ul>
  <li>All leading determinants of $S$ are $&gt;0$. Leading determinants are determinants of all square sub-matrices of $S$ with the top-left corner fixed.</li>
  <li>All <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_element">pivots</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination">Gaussian elimination</a> are $&gt;0$.</li>
  <li>$S$ can be factored as $S = A^{\rm T}A$, where $A$ has independent columns.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="energy-in-a-vector-x">Energy in a vector $x$</h2>
<p>For a matrix $S$, the energy is a vector $x$ is defined by $x^{\rm T}Sx$. For example, consider</p>

\[\begin{align*}
x=\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}, &amp; &amp; S=\begin{pmatrix}
    3 &amp; 4\\
    4 &amp; 6
    \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}.\]

<p>The corresponding energy is $f(a,b)=x^{\rm T}Sx=3a^2 + 6b^2 + 8ab$. Below is the plot for $f(a,b)$ showing that energy $&gt;0$ for all $a$ and $b$. Thus, the matrix $S$ in this example is positive definite.</p>

<p>On a side note, this can be seen like a loss function that one may try to minimize using something simple like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent</a>.</p>

<p>If two matrices $A$ and $B$ are PD, then so is $A+B$ and $A^{-1}$ (if it exists). This can be easily seen by the positive energy property and the fact that the $\lambda_i(A^{-1})=1/\lambda_i(A)$.</p>

<p>Semi-definiteness is analogous to being non-negative. This means that all the inequalities mentioned in the <a href="#properties">properties</a> above</p>
