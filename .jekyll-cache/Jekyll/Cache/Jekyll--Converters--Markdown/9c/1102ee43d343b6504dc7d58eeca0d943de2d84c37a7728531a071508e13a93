I"Y<p>Let a matrix $Q$ have orthonormal columns. The most important property of such a matrix is that</p>

\[Q^TQ = I\]

<p>But what about $QQ^T$? A little thought reveals that $QQ^T = I$ only if $Q$ is a square matrix, but not in general. In this square case, $Q$ is called orthogonal (or orthonormal). Itâ€™s confusing to say orthogonal when we actually mean orthonormal, but most results rely on the fact that a bunch of orthogonal vectors $v_i$ can be made orthonormal by scaling them to have $\lVert v_i\rVert = 1$. Hence, in a lot of places we see the word orthogonal being used when the authors actually mean orthonormal.</p>

<p>A simple example of a $2\times 2$ orthogonal matrix is the rotation matrix
\(Q = \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta &amp; -\sin\theta \\
    \sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta
    \end{pmatrix}\),
or the reflection matrix
\(Q = \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta &amp; \sin\theta \\
    \sin\theta &amp; -\cos\theta
    \end{pmatrix}\)</p>

<p>The rotation matrix simple rotates a vector by $\theta$ in the anti-clockwise direction, while the reflection matrix reflects a vector about a mirror placed on a line of slope $\tan(\theta/2)$ passing through the origin.</p>

<p>Side note: these reflections are called <span class="text-green-200">Householder reflections</span>.</p>

<h2 id="householder-reflections">Householder reflections</h2>
<p>Start with a unit vector $u$, so $u^Tu = 1$. The Householder reflections are defined to be a family of symmetric orthogonal matrices as follows:</p>

\[H = I - 2uu^T\]

<p>It is easy to see that $H$ is orthogonal by checking that $H^TH = I$.</p>

<h2 id="hadamard-matrices">Hadamard matrices</h2>
<p>Define the $2$-dimensional Hadamard matrix by</p>

\[H_2 =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    1 &amp; -1
    \end{pmatrix}\]

<p>Then define \(H_{2^{n+1}} = \begin{pmatrix}
    H_{2^n} &amp; H_{2^n} \\
    H_{2^n} &amp; -H_{2^n}
    \end{pmatrix}\)
for all $n &gt; 1$.</p>

<p>This gives a construction of these matrices for any power of 2. But in general, it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_matrix#Hadamard_conjecture">conjectured</a> that Hadamard matrices for any multiple of 4 exist.</p>
