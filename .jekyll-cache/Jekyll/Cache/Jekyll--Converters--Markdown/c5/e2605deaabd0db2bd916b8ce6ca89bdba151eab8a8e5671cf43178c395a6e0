I"7<p>This is my recollection of a few preliminary ideas and developments in Linear Algebra, and is supposed to serve as a reference for some common results and properties. Hence, almost all proofs are omitted. Most of the content is inspired by the book <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Linear_Algebra.html?id=YF2CQgAACAAJ">Linear Algebra - Peter D. Lax</a> and <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/">Gilbert Strangâ€™s Spring 2018 course at MIT</a>.</p>
