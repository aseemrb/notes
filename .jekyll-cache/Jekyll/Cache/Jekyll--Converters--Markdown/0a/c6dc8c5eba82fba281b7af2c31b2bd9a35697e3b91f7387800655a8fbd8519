I"ù<p>If a matrix $Q$ has orthonormal columns, then we say it‚Äôs orthogonal (or orthonormal). It‚Äôs confusing to say orthogonal when we actually mean orthonormal, but most results rely on the fact that a bunch of orthogonal vectors $v_i$ can be made orthonormal by scaling them to have $|| v_i|| = 1$. Hence, in a lot of places we see the word orthogonal being used when the authors actually mean orthonormal.</p>
