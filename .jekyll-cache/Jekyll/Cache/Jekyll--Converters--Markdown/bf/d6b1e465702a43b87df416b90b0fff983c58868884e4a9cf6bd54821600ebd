I"ù<p>This is my recollection of a few preliminary ideas and developments in Linear Algebra, and is supposed to serve as a reference for some common results and properties. Hence, almost all proofs are omitted. Most of the content is inspired by the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lax">Linear Algebra</a> by <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Linear_Algebra.html?id=YF2CQgAACAAJ">Peter D. Lax</a> and a <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/">course</a> by <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/">Gilbert Strang</a> in Spring 2018 at MIT.</p>
