I"?<p>If a matrix $Q$ has orthonormal columns, then we say it’s orthogonal (or orthonormal). It’s confusing to say orthogonal when we actually mean orthonormal, but most results rely on the fact that a bunch of orthogonal vectors $v_i$ can be made orthonormal by scaling them to have $\left\ v_i\right\rVert = 1$.</p>
