<Aside type="tip" title="Definition: Probability space" icon="open-book">
A probability space is a triplet $(\Omega, \cF, \Pr)$, where $\Omega$ is called the **sample space**, $\cF$ is called a **$\sigma$-Field** and $\Pr$ is called the **probability measure**.
</Aside>

## Sample space
This is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. For example, consider rolling a $6$-sided die. Then the sample space is $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

## Defining a σ-Field

<Aside type="tip" title="Definition: σ-Field" icon="open-book">
A set of subsets of $\Omega$, denoted by $\cF$, is called a <span class="text-accent">$\sigma$-Field on $\Omega$</span> if it satisfies the following properties:
- <span class="text-accent">$\cF$ contains the sample space.</span>
$\Omega \in \cF$.
- <span class="text-accent">$\cF$ is closed under complements.</span>
$A\in\cF \implies A^c\in \cF$.
- <span class="text-accent">$\cF$ is closed under countable unions.</span>
$A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \cF \implies \cup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i\in \cF$.
</Aside>

## Examples
The intuitive way to think about a $\sigma$-Field is to view it as a collection (set) of events. <span class="text-accent">Every member of $\cF$ is an event</span>. A few examples:

<Aside type="tip" title="Examples: σ-fields" icon="open-book">
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Example 1">
The trivial $\sigma$-Field given by $\cF = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$, where $\emptyset$ denotes the empty set.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Example 2">
Power set of $\Omega$ given by $\cF = \{2^{\Omega}\}$, which denotes the collection of all subsets of $\Omega$.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Example 3">
For any fixed subset $A\subset\Omega$, the set given by $\cF = \{\emptyset,A,A^c,\Omega\}$.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Example 4">
The set $\cF = \{A: A$ is countable or $A^c$ is countable $\}$.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</Aside>

The four examples above can be verified to be a $\sigma$-Field by simply verifying the three properties described above. For example 4, the third property is non-trivial, and can be verified using the following argument:

Consider a countable sequence of events $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}\in\cF$. If all $A_i$ are countable, then $B=\cup_i A_i$ is countable and so $B\in\cF$; whereas, if there exists some $j$ such that $A_j$ is uncountable, it means that $A_j^c$ is countable by definition of $\cF$. Now see that since $A_j\subseteq B=\cup_i A_i$, we have $B^c\subseteq A_j^c$. Hence, $B^c$ is countable, implying that $B\in \cF$ by definition.

## Counterexample
It is natural at this point to ask for an example of a set which is not a $\sigma$-Field. Let's construct one!

Let $\Omega = (0, 1]$, and define

$$
\cB_0 = \{\text{finite unions of disjoint subintervals of }\Omega\}.
$$

At first glance, one might believe that $\cB_0$ is a $\sigma$-Field, but it is not. It is actually a <span class="text-accent">field</span> (more on that later), but not a $\sigma$-Field.

<Aside type="caution" title="Exercise 1" icon="pencil">
Show that $\cB_0$ is not a $\sigma$-Field by identifying which property (among the three listed in the definition) breaks.
