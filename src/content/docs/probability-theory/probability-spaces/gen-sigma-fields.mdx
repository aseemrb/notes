For a sample space $\Omega$, let $\cA$ be a set of subsets of $\Omega$. Suppose we want to generate a $\sigma$-Field using $\cA$. Note that there may be many different $\sigma$-Fields $\cF$ such that $\cA\subseteq\cF$. Hence, to make this generation unique, we will focus on the smallest such $\cF$.

<Aside type="tip" title="Definition: σ-Field generated by A" icon="open-book">
The $\sigma$-Field generated by $\cA$, denoted by <span class="text-accent">$\sigma(\cA)$</span>, is the intersection of all the $\sigma$-Fields $\cF_i$ such that $\cA\subseteq\cF_i$.
</Aside>

## Examples
1. For $\cA=\{\emptyset\}$ or $\cA=\{\Omega\}$, $\sigma(\cA)=\{\emptyset, \Omega\}$, the trivial $\sigma$-Field.
2. For $\cA=\{A\}$ for some $A\subset\Omega$, $\sigma(\cA)=\{\emptyset, A, A^c, \Omega\}$.
3. For $\cA=\{\{\omega\}: \omega\in\Omega\}$, $\sigma(\cA)=\{A: A$ is countable or $A^c$ is countable $\}$.

<Aside type="caution" title="Exercise 2" icon="pencil">
1. Show that for any collection $\cA$ of subsets of $\Omega$, $\sigma(\cA)$ is indeed a $\sigma$-Field.
2. Verify example 3 above.

## The Borel σ-Field
Denoted by <span class="text-accent">$\cB$</span>, the Borel $\sigma$-Field is defined on the sample space $\Omega=(0,1]$. It is the <span class="text-accent">$\sigma$-Field generated by $\cB_0 = \{\text{finite unions of disjoint subintervals of }\Omega\}$</span> (recall that we saw this set earlier as [a counterexample for $\sigma$-Fields](../sigma-fields/#counterexample)). Note that one can define the Borel $\sigma$-Field on $\R$ in the same way as we did for $\Omega$.

It is well known that <span class="text-accent">$\cB$ can also be generated by open, closed, and half-open sets</span>. Formally, let
- $\cQ=\{(a, b]\subseteq\Omega\}$
- $\cR=\{(a, b)\subseteq\Omega\}$
- $\cS=\{[a, b]\subseteq\Omega\}$
- $\cT=\{[a, b)\subseteq\Omega\}$

The notation above may feel a little weird, but essentially it says that $\cQ$ is the set of all intervals of $\Omega$ that are open on the left and closed on the right (similarly for the other three sets).

Prove that $\sigma(\cQ) = \sigma(\cR) = \sigma(\cS) = \sigma(\cT) = \cB$.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Hint">
The countably infinite union of a carefully chosen sequence of left-open intervals (elements of $\cQ$) can generate an open interval (an element of $\cR$).

Similarly, the countably infinite intersection of a chosen sequence of open intervals (elements of $\cR$) can generate a closed interval (an element of $\cS$), and so on.
