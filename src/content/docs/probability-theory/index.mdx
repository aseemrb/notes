This section is about measure theoretic probability and some related topics. Most of the technical content is inspired from a course I took at UWaterloo, given by [Yi Shen](https://sites.google.com/site/yishenenglish/) and [Durrett](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/)'s popular book [Probability: Theory and Examples](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/), with some additional tidbits from my personal experience that helped me build a good intuition on the subject.

## Prerequisites
1. Real Analysis:
    - Sequences & Series: Convergence, Cauchy sequences, subsequences.
    - Limits & Continuity: Epsilon-delta definitions, uniform continuity, properties of continuous functions.
    - Metric Spaces: Distance, open/closed balls, completeness.
    - Integration: Riemann integration and its limitations (leading to Lebesgue).
2. Set Theory:
    - Union, intersection, complement, De Morgan's laws, Cartesian products.
    - Power Sets & Collections of Sets: Working with sets of sets.
    - Axiom of Choice: Understanding its implications.
3. General Topology (helpful but not absolutely necessary):
    - Topological Spaces: Open sets, closed sets, neighborhoods.
    - Continuity in Topological Spaces.

## What is measure theory?
Measure theory is a mathematical framework that helps us understand what measuring the "size" of subsets of a certain set means. In some sense, it is a formal generalization of geometrical measures (e.g. length for 1-dimensional, area for 2-dimensional, and volume for higher dimensional objects).

## Relation to probability theory
After measure theory was developed in the early 20th century, Soviet mathematician [Andrey Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov) discovered that it can also be used to provide a rigorous foundation to probability.

While probability involves some extra ideas (relative to the rest of mathematics), the issue was whether it required a new technical ingredient to be added to the rest of mathematics. Kolmogorov's achievement was the realization that it didn't. With agreed axioms, mathematicians systematically developed theorem-proof probability. The connection to the rest of theorem-proof mathematics enabled the use of other mathematical tools, especially the limit theorems.
