This section is about measure theoretic probability and some related topics. Most of the technical content is inspired from a course I took at UWaterloo, given by [Yi Shen](https://sites.google.com/site/yishenenglish/) and [Durrett](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/)'s popular book [Probability: Theory and Examples](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/), with some additional tidbits from my personal experience that helped me build a good intuition on the subject.

## Prerequisites
1. Real analysis:
    - Sequences & series: Convergence, Cauchy sequences, subsequences.
    - Limits & continuity: Epsilon-delta definitions, uniform continuity, properties of continuous functions.
    - Metric spaces: Distance, open/closed balls, completeness.
    - Integration: Riemann integration and its limitations (leading to Lebesgue).
2. Set theory:
    - Union, intersection, complement, De Morgan's laws, Cartesian products.
    - Power sets & collections of sets: Working with sets of sets.
    - Axiom of choice: Understanding its implications.
3. General topology (helpful but not absolutely necessary):
    - Topological spaces: Open sets, closed sets, neighborhoods.
    - Continuity in topological spaces.

## What is Measure Theory?
Measure theory is a mathematical framework that helps us understand what measuring the "size" of subsets of a certain set means. In some sense, it is a formal generalization of geometrical measures (e.g. length for 1-dimensional, area for 2-dimensional, and volume for higher dimensional objects).

## Motivation: Why do we need Measure Theory?
To understand why Measure Theory exists, we first have to realize that the Riemann integration we learned in high school has a "blind spot." It works great for a certain class of functions, but fails when functions get too "jittery" or "broken".

### An analogy
Think about the size of the interval $[0, 1]$. One might intuitively say that it is $1-0 = 1$. This intuition is correct if it is formalized, and it is easy to see that using that formalization, one can compute the size of any interval $[a, b]$, which is $b-a$.

Note that these intervals are one of the "simplest" subsets of the set of real numbers $\R$. But, there can be subsets of $\R$ that are much more complex. For example, how would you compute the "size" of a collection of scattered points? Or the size of all the irrational numbers between $0$ and $1$?

Measure Theory is the rigorous framework for assigning a "size" to subsets of a space in a way that remains consistent even when those subsets are highly complex and incredibly hard to describe. We will see many examples of such subsets later. I promise this will become more intuitive if you keep reading and be patient (especially after going through the [Lebesgue measure](./probability-spaces/lebesgue-measure)).

## Relation to Probability Theory
After measure theory was developed in the early 20th century, Soviet mathematician [Andrey Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov) discovered that it can also be used to provide a rigorous foundation to probability.

While probability involves some extra ideas (relative to the rest of mathematics), the issue was whether it required a new technical ingredient to be added to the rest of mathematics. Kolmogorov's achievement was the realization that it didn't. With agreed axioms, mathematicians systematically developed theorem-proof probability. The connection to the rest of theorem-proof mathematics enabled the use of other mathematical tools, especially the limit theorems.
