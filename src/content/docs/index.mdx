## What is this?
My notes on various topics. The primary reason to create this is that I usually find it easier to grasp stuff better when I write things down after a few days of studying them. Another reason is that it is indexed and searchable, so looking for a specific construction / proof / idea should be quicker.

## What this is not
This is not a textbook or a course. It is a collection of notes on various topics, and is not intended to be a substitute for a textbook or a course. More specifically, it is not a replacement for a course without any prerequisites, but rather a supplement to it. It is highly recommended to have a good understanding of the prerequisites before reading this. I have tried to list the prerequisites for each topic in their Introductions, but it is not exhaustive.

The common prerequisite across all topics is mathematical maturity:
- Rigorous proofs: Ability to read, understand, and construct formal mathematical proofs.
- Abstract thinking: Comfort with abstract definitions and general spaces.

## Contact
1. I'd be very grateful if you find any errors and report them to me.
2. If you have any suggestions for topics that you'd like to see here (in the vicinity of mathematics and CS in general), I'd be happy to take them if time permits.
