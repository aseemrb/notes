## What is this?
My notes on various topics. The primary reason to create this is that I usually find it easier to grasp stuff better when I write things down after a few days of studying them. Another reason is that I indexed it and made it searchable, so looking for a specific result / idea should ideally be quicker.

## Contact
1. I'd be very grateful if you find any errors and report them to [notes@aseemrb.me](mailto:notes@aseemrb.me).
2. If you have suggestions for topics that you want included here (in the vicinity of mathematics and CS in general), I'd be happy to take them if time permits.
